## Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota 

Welcome to my profile! I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. I'm passionate about researching how policy changes affect childcare labor markets and the role minimum wages play in the childcare industry. 

### :mag_right: Research Interests

I'm interested in causal inference, econometrics, economic modeling, and machine learning. I believe that combining these fields can lead to powerful insights into economic phenomena.

### :books: Learning

I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in different areas of economics. Currently, I'm diving into Industrial Organization and Structural Modeling. I believe that understanding different fields within economics can help me to approach problems from different angles and provide more robust solutions.

### :computer: Work Experience

I'm currently a Graduate Research Assistant for Elizabeth Davis (University of Minnesota) and Aaron Sojourner (UPJOHN Institute). Through this experience, I've had the opportunity to work on projects that have real-world impacts.

### :zap: Fun Fact

When I'm not busy with research, I enjoy nerding out with multiplayer video games, and reading for fun. Did you know that I'm fluent in three languages? Most are programming languages :)
